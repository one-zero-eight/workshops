## Development

### Set up for development

1. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```
3. Start development server (and read logs in the terminal):
   ```bash
   uv run -m src.api --reload
   ```
   > Follow the provided instructions (if needed).
4. Open in the browser: http://localhost:8005
   > The api will be reloaded when you edit the code

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For endpoints requiring authorization click "Authorize" button in Swagger UI

> [!TIP]
> Edit `settings.yaml` according to your needs, you can view schema in
> [config_schema.py](src/config_schema.py) and in [settings.schema.yaml](settings.schema.yaml)

**Set up PyCharm integrations**

1. Run configurations ([docs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/run-debug-configuration.html#createExplicitly)).
   Right-click the `__main__.py` file in the project explorer, select `Run '__main__'` from the context menu.
2. Ruff ([plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20574-ruff)).
   It will lint and format your code. Make sure to enable `Use ruff format` option in plugin settings.
3. Pydantic ([plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12861-pydantic)). It will fix PyCharm issues with
   type-hinting.
4. Conventional commits ([plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13389-conventional-commit)). It will help you
   to write [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

### Deployment

We use Docker with Docker Compose plugin to run the service on servers.

1. Copy the file with environment variables: `cp .example.env .env`
2. Change environment variables in the `.env` file
3. Copy the file with settings: `cp settings.example.yaml settings.yaml`
4. Change settings in the `settings.yaml` file according to your needs
   (check [settings.schema.yaml](settings.schema.yaml) for more info)
5. Install Docker with Docker Compose
6. Run the containers: `docker compose up --build --wait`
7. Check the logs: `docker compose logs -f`

## FAQ

### Be up to date with the template!

Check https://github.com/one-zero-eight/fastapi-template for updates once in a while.

### How to update dependencies

1. Run `uv sync --upgrade` to update uv.lock file and install the latest versions of the dependencies.
2. Run `uv tree --outdated --depth=1` will show what package versions are installed and what are the latest versions.
3. Run `uv run pre-commit autoupdate`

Also, Dependabot will help you to keep your dependencies up-to-date, see [dependabot.yaml](.github/dependabot.yaml).

### How to run tests?

1. Create `test-db` database in your local PostgreSQL:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it workshops-db-1 psql -U postgres -c 'CREATE DATABASE "test-db";'
   ```
2. Run tests with `SETTINGS_PATH=settings.test.yaml uv run pytest`

### How to setup database?

1. Run `docker compose up -d db` to start the PostgreSQL container (create `.env` file with options if needed)
2. Run `uv run alembic upgrade head` to apply all pending migrations
3. Run `uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"` to create new migration
4. Run `uv run alembic current` to check current migration status
5. Revert all migrations: `uv run alembic downgrade base`
6. Just set to `base` to revert to the initial state: `uv run alembic stamp base`
